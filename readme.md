# Heatpump Monitor

This is a technical github repository for OpenEnergyMonitor open hardware and software heat-pump performance monitoring development.

## Rationale

Heat-pumps are a key component of zero carbon energy systems making it possible to provide heating efficiently from renewable energy, they are featured in many zero carbon energy scenarios such as ZeroCarbonBritain developed by the Centre for Alternative Technology and are also highlighted in David MacKay's book Sustainable Energy without the hot air.

By monitoring a heat-pump its possible to see how well it is working, diagnose problems and get a better understanding of how a key potentially zero carbon heating solution works, data gathered and shared from well performing systems could help de-mystify heat-pump operation and help improve performance by diagnosing any problems early.

## Getting started

The heat pump monitoring application guide in the main OpenEnergyMonitor guide is a good place to start, covering the different options, including the use of the main OpenEnergyMonitor hardware:

## Hardware

### EmonPi or EmonTx based heat pump monitor

</td><td>
<br>Electricity consumption and system temperatures</b><br>
<p>Monitor electricity consumption and system temperatures using clip-on CT sensors and one-wire temperature sensors connected to an emonPi or emonTx. This provides the simplest solution for installation on existing systems.</p>

<b>Using external MBUS reader module</b><br>
<p>An external MBUS reader connected to the emonPi or emonBase can be used to read from high accuracy electricity and heat meters.</p>
