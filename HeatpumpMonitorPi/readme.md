![images/hpmon_small.jpg](images/hpmon_small.jpg)

This is a new heat pump monitor board designed specifically for interfacing with MID standard electricity and heat meters via MBUS. It has a RaspberryPi at itâ€™s core running our emonSD image enabling local or/and remote logging and data visualisation.

This design combines RaspberryPi, [heat pump monitoring baseboard](baseboard) and the [USB to MBUS reader](../USB_MBUS_Reader) board into a single unit.
