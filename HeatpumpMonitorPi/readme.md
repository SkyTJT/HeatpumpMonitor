## RaspberryPi & MBUS based heat pump monitor

This is a new heat pump monitor board designed specifically for interfacing with MID standard electricity and heat meters via MBUS. It has a RaspberryPi at itâ€™s core running our emonSD image enabling local or/and remote logging and data visualisation.

It is designed for monitoring heat pump electricity consumption, heat output and system temperatures for detailed performance analysis & troubleshooting.

### Features

- MBUS Reader (Reads from connected electricity and heat meters)
- DS18B20 Temperature sensor connections
- 6 Digital input or outputs can be used for pulse counting
- I2C connection (uses 2 of the 6 digital IO's)
- RaspberryPi running the OpenEnergyMonitor emonSD image

This hardware design combines in a single unit a: 

- RaspberryPi
- [Heat pump monitoring baseboard](baseboard)
- [USB to MBUS reader](../USB_MBUS_Reader)

### Tested MBUS meters:

- SDM120-MBUS electricity meter
- Qalcosonic E3 heat meter
- Sontex 531 (e.g part of Superstatic 440 range of heat meters)

Should also work with Kamstrup 402, Sharky 775 (See [forum post on Sharky 775](https://community.openenergymonitor.org/t/newbie-hardware-question/16242/31)). Testing required to confirm that these meters continue to work with the latest MBUS reader software.

### Setup

The following setup instructions assume an assembled heat pump monitor kit as shown in the picture above, with pre-prepared SD card running the standard emonSD image inserted into the RaspberryPi **(with SSH enabled, see [Guide: Credentials](https://guide.openenergymonitor.org/technical/credentials/))**.

1. Use the connection diagram above to connect MBUS meters, temperature sensors and power. There are two A and B MBUS terminals that can be used to simplify connecting two meters to the MBUS reader. Make sure that the power supply is capable of supplying 2A e.g [OpenEnergyMonitor Shop 5V USB Power Adapter](https://shop.openenergymonitor.com/5v-dc-usb-power-adapter-uk-plug) (MBUS data corruption can occur if the power supply output is too low).

2. Power up the unit, wait a couple of minutes for the Pi to create a WiFi access point. Connect to the access point and then use the WiFi configuration interface to connect the unit to your home WiFi. See [Guide: Connect](https://guide.openenergymonitor.org/setup/connect/) for full details.

3. If you have connected DS18B20 temperature sensors a couple of minor steps are required to enable reading from DS18B20 temperature sensors on the Pi. Follow steps 1 to 4 here [EmonHub Interfacers: Direct DS18B20 temperature sensing](https://guide.openenergymonitor.org/integrations/emonhub-interfacers/#direct-ds18b20-temperature-sensing).

4. EmonHub is piece of software running on the Pi that reads from the connected MBUS meters and DS18B20 temperature sensors. It then forwards the data to a seperate piece of software called Emoncms for data storage and visualisation. EmonHub is configured using a configuration file located at: /etc/emonhub/emonhub.conf. A configuration example is included at the bottom of this page for reading from a SDM120-MBUS electricity meter, a Qalcosonic E3 heat meter and DS18B20 temperature sensors. Overwrite the existing default configuration with this configuration as it is a better starting point for our requirements.

5. Configure EmonHub MBUS settings. The default MBUS configuration settings below assume that an SDM120-MBUS meter is configured to use MBUS address 1 and the Qalcosonic E3 heat meter is configured to use address 2. You may need to adjust the MBUS address of either of the meters to ensure that they are not both on the same address. See instructions in the forum post here on how to do this: https://community.openenergymonitor.org/t/reading-from-multiple-mbus-meters-with-the-emonhub-mbus-interfacer/18159

6. Changing the default example configuration with a Qalcosonic E3 heat meter to a Sontex 531:

```
[[MBUS]]
    Type = EmonHubMBUSInterfacer
    [[[init_settings]]]
        device = /dev/ttyAMA0
        baud = 2400
    [[[runtimesettings]]]
        pubchannels = ToEmonCMS,
        read_interval = 10
        validate_checksum = False
        nodename = mbus
        [[[[meters]]]]
            [[[[[sdm120]]]]]
               address = 1
               type = sdm120
            [[[[[sontex]]]]]
                address = 2
                type = sontex531
```

7. With the hardware connected up and the settings in place, data should now be coming in and be listed as inputs in Emoncms.

### Example test setup

Reading from a SDM120-MBUS electricity meter and a Qalcosonic E3 heat meter. These, or similar meters would usually be installed as part of heat pump installation.

### Example EmonHub Configuration

The following is a full */etc/emonhub/emonhub.conf* example that reads from any connected DS18B20 temperature sensors, an SDM120-MBUS electricity meter and a Qalcosonic E3 heat meter. Data is forwarded to the local emoncms installation using MQTT and the remote emoncms installation via HTTP.
